# Odin Project - Recipes

## Description
This project is used to display some of my favorite recipes usting .html files on a static site. This is not a dynamic site and currently will not use a service to get the data to display on the pages. All recipes will be added to the `recipes` folder and the main page (`index.html`), will have links to each recipe separately.

Since these are static pages, they can be run using the `live-server` npm package.

## Recipes
* Magic Peanut Butter Middles
* No Back COokies III
* Peanut Butter Chip Chocolate Cookies
